# SQL Lesson 15: Deleting rows

## This database is getting too big, lets remove all movies that were released before 2005
```sql
DELETE FROM movies
WHERE year < 2005;
```

## Andrew Stanton has also left the studio, so please remove all movies directed by him.
```sql
DELETE FROM movies
WHERE director = "Andrew Stanton"
```
