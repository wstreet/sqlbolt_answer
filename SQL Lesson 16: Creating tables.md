## Create a new table named Database with the following columns:

* Name A string (text) describing the name of the database
* Version A number (floating point) of the latest version of this database
* Download_count An integer count of the number of times this database was downloaded
This table has no constraints.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Database (
    Name TEXT,
    Version FLOAT,
    Download_count  INTEGER
)
```
